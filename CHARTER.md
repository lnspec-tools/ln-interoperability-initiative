# "Async Main and Test" Charter

## Goals

This working group is focused around implementing and design one of the last 
steps to make the [async-wg vision](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async/vision.html) real.
In particular, we are focusing to find a way to be able to have an async main, and tests 
out of the box without need a third party library.
